BUGS
- Step 3 - error with reservation extras
- Step 2 - after selecting dates (13th - 15th), it is saying no sites available - but I should not be able to select these dates - but actually there are some sites available
- Step 4 - dont allow next button to be clicked until guest details are filled in

IMPROVEMENTS
- Step 1 - when choosing a site type, the content reloads. (flashes)
- the first unavailable date should have the lable "checkout only"
